## 1. Module Overview

### Purpose
The People module captures the day-to-day self-reported activity of employees — expenses claimed for business travel and operations, requests to work from home, and daily activity logs (what did I work on today). These records are submitted by employees and approved through the standard approval workflow. Reports from this module answer: **Are employees claiming expenses appropriately, working from home by policy, and logging their daily output?**

### Business Goals
- Ensure expense claims are legitimate, within policy, and accurately reimbursed.
- Maintain visibility into WFH patterns across the organization.
- Provide Finance with expense accruals for cost control.
- Give managers transparency into what their team is working on daily.

### Reporting Goals
1. Give Finance a monthly expense summary ready for reimbursement processing.
2. Surface expense policy violations before they are reimbursed.
3. Give managers a team-level view of WFH usage.
4. Provide HR with daily activity data as an operational productivity signal.

## 5. Backend Requirements

### `buildReport()` Features Required

| Feature | Reports |
|---|---|
| Date range on `expenseDate`, `wfhDate`, `activityDate` | P-01, P-06, P-08 |
| Row-level scope (`isManagedBy`, `isSelf`) | All reports |
| Aggregation `SUM(amount)` by employee/category/dept | P-01, P-03, P-04 |
| Cross-model join: DailyActivity + Client | P-09 |
| Computed field: `daysOverdue = TODAY - submittedDate` | P-02 |
| Policy limit comparison (expense ceiling per category) | P-05 |
| Time-bucket grouping (monthly) | P-07 |

### Expense Policy Config
P-05 (Expense Exceptions) requires a `ExpensePolicy` config (or stored in `GeneralSettings`) defining per-category spending limits. This is a **configuration read**, not hardcoded logic. The `columnResolver` / `aggregationEngine` must join this config at query time.

### API Design
```
POST /api/reports/people/:reportId
GET  /api/reports/people/:reportId/export
```

## 6. Future Considerations (Architecture Only)

1. **Expense Receipt OCR:** When receipt attachments are added to `Expense`, an OCR pipeline could validate that claimed amounts match the attached receipt — purely data verification, not AI inference.
2. **WFH Policy Enforcement:** If a `wfhAllowance` (days per month) is added to `LeavePolicy`, the WFH Summary report can automatically flag employees who exceeded their monthly WFH quota — no new report needed, just an additional column.
3. **Daily Activity Completeness Cron:** A daily cron that checks which employees submitted no activity log for the previous working day and fires a reminder notification — reuses existing notification infrastructure.
