## 1. Module Overview

### Purpose
The Assets module tracks the full lifecycle of every physical asset owned by the organization — from purchase order to disposal. It connects procurement (purchases, vendors), operations (allocations, repairs), compliance (damage recovery, insurance), and finance (asset cost, vendor payments). Reports from this module answer: **Where is every asset, who has it, what condition is it in, and what has it cost us?**

### Business Goals
- Maintain a 100% accurate real-time asset register — zero untracked assets.
- Ensure all allocated assets are with the correct employee and in documented condition.
- Track financial exposure from damage incidents and repair costs.
- Provide purchase history for budget forecasting and vendor performance.

### Reporting Goals
1. Enable an Admin to verify every asset's location and custodian in seconds.
2. Surface assets that are damaged, under repair, or lost so management can act.
3. Provide Finance with asset purchase costs and depreciation visibility.
4. Make the employee exit process safer by flagging unreturned assets.

## 5. Backend Requirements

### `buildReport()` Features Required

| Feature | Reports |
|---|---|
| Cross-model join: Asset + AssetAllocation | A-01, A-03, A-04, A-06 |
| Cross-model join: Asset + AssetIncident | A-07 |
| Cross-model join: Asset + AssetRepair | A-08 |
| Cross-model join: AssetAllocation + Employee (status) | A-04 |
| Row-level scope (`isManagedBy`) | A-03, A-04, A-06 |
| `isSelf` scope | A-06 (employee self-view) |
| Date range filter on `allocationDate`, `sentDate`, `purchaseDate` | A-03, A-08, A-10 |
| Aggregation with `SUM` (recovery amount, purchase cost) | A-07, A-09, A-10 |
| Computed field: `daysInRepair = TODAY - sentDate` | A-08 |
| Computed field: `daysSinceSeparation = TODAY - lastWorkingDay` | A-04 |
| `groupBy` category/status | A-02, A-10 |

### A-04 Special Logic (Unreturned Assets)
This report requires a cross-model join across:
1. `assetallocations` (status = Active)
2. `employees` (status ∈ [Resigned, Terminated, On Notice])

The engine must NOT rely on a single collection. This is a declarative multi-model join that `buildReport()` must support via `$lookup` pipeline stages.

### API Design
```
POST /api/reports/assets/:reportId
GET  /api/reports/assets/:reportId/export
```

### Performance Considerations
- Index: `assetallocations.status`, `assetallocations.employeeId`, `assets.status`, `assets.category`
- A-04 (Unreturned Assets) requires compound index: `{ status: 1, employeeId: 1 }` on `assetallocations`
- A-08 (Active Repairs): `{ status: 1, sentDate: 1 }` on `assetrepairs`

---

## 6. Future Considerations (Architecture Only)

1. **Asset Depreciation Engine:** Add a computed `currentValue` field based on purchase cost, asset age, and a configurable depreciation rate per category. This enables a Balance Sheet–level Asset Valuation report for Finance without manual calculation.
2. **QR Code / Barcode Integration:** Link each `Asset._id` to a QR code for mobile scan-based stock verification. The `AssetStockLedger` audit trail already supports this; only the scanning UI needs to be added.
3. **Warranty Expiry Notifications:** A cron checking `asset.warrantyExpiry` within 30/60/90 days and firing notifications through the existing `NotificationRule` infrastructure — no separate report needed, uses existing data.
4. **Insurance Tracking:** Add an `insurance` subdocument to `Asset` (insurer, policy number, premium, expiry) to enable an Insurance Expiry report for Admin/Finance.
