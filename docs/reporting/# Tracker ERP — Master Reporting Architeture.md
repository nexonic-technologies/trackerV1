## 1. Reporting Philosophy

Tracker reports exist to answer **one business question per report**.

A report is successful when a manager can make a decision from it within minutes. Not when it looks impressive. Not when it has many charts. When the right number, in the right context, leads to a clear action.

**The chain of trust:**
```
Raw business events (punches, tasks, payments)
        ↓
Trusted records in Tracker (MongoDB collections)
        ↓
Aggregation via buildReport() (single engine)
        ↓
Role-filtered, column-secured result
        ↓
Report UI (table + optional chart)
        ↓
Decision by manager
```

Every number presented in a report must be traceable to the individual records that produced it via drill-down. No number may be presented without that traceability.

## 3. Shared Backend Architecture

### 3.1 Report Engine — `buildReport()`

The existing `buildReportQuery.js` handles basic aggregation and population. The full reporting system requires it to be extended with the following shared services:

```
src/reportEngine/
├── buildReport.js           ← Extended core (wraps buildReportQuery)
├── aggregationEngine.js     ← SUM/COUNT/AVG/groupBy/subGroupBy/date-bucket
├── permissionResolver.js    ← Role → allowed rows (ABAC policies)
├── columnResolver.js        ← Strips restricted columns from results
├── dateRangeResolver.js     ← { startDate, endDate, dateField } → $match
├── drillDownResolver.js     ← { reportId, kpiKey, filters } → detail query
├── exportGenerator.js       ← Excel (xlsx), CSV (custom schema), PDF (pdfkit)
└── cacheLayer.js            ← TTL cache keyed by reportId+filters+roleId
```

**Design rule:** No report implements its own aggregation logic. All computation flows through these shared services. This guarantees consistent numbers across all reports that read the same data.

---

### 3.2 `aggregationEngine.js` — Contract

```js
/**
 * Build a MongoDB aggregation pipeline for a report.
 *
 * @param {Object} config
 * @param {string} config.modelName         — Target collection
 * @param {Object} config.filter            — Pre-validated ABAC filter ($match stage)
 * @param {Object} config.dateRange         — { startDate, endDate, dateField }
 * @param {string} config.groupBy           — Field to group by
 * @param {string} [config.subGroupBy]      — Secondary grouping field
 * @param {string[]} [config.sum]           — Fields to SUM
 * @param {string[]} [config.count]         — Fields to COUNT
 * @param {string[]} [config.avg]           — Fields to AVG
 * @param {string[]} [config.populate]      — Lookup joins before grouping
 * @param {Object}  [config.sort]           — MongoDB sort stage
 * @param {number}  [config.limit]          — Pagination limit
 * @param {number}  [config.skip]           — Pagination skip
 * @param {Object}  [config.computedFields] — { fieldName: $expr definition }
 *
 * @returns {Object[]} MongoDB aggregation pipeline
 */
export function buildAggregationPipeline(config) { ... }
```

**Computed field support** (server-side, not frontend):
- `daysOverdue`: `{ $max: [0, { $subtract: [today, "$dueDate"] }] }` / 86400000
- `daysInStatus`: `{ $subtract: [today, "$lastStatusChangedAt"] }` / 86400000
- `firstResponseTime`: requires sub-pipeline join to comments collection
- `agingBucket`: `$switch` on `daysOverdue`
- `resolutionTime`: `{ $subtract: ["$resolvedAt", "$createdAt"] }` / 3600000

---

### 3.3 `permissionResolver.js` — Contract

```js
/**
 * Returns the row-level $match filter for a given user + reportId.
 *
 * Rules:
 * - Superadmin/HR: no row filter (all rows)
 * - Manager: filter by { assignedTo: { $in: managedEmployeeIds } }
 *            OR { department: managerId.department }
 * - Employee (isSelf): filter by { employeeId: userId } or { assignedTo: userId }
 * - Finance: no salary filter; receives salary columns
 *
 * @param {Object} user    — { id, role, managedEmployees[], department }
 * @param {string} reportId
 * @returns {Object}       — MongoDB $match filter to inject into pipeline
 */
export function resolveRowPermission(user, reportId) { ... }
```

---

### 3.4 `columnResolver.js` — Contract

```js
/**
 * Strips columns the user's role is not permitted to see.
 *
 * Column rules are defined per report in the reporting config registry.
 * Example: salary columns (grossSalary, netSalary, earnedBreakdown) are
 * stripped for all roles except Finance and HR.
 *
 * @param {Object[]} rows     — Raw result from aggregation
 * @param {string}   role     — User role
 * @param {string}   reportId
 * @returns {Object[]}        — Rows with restricted columns removed
 */
export function stripRestrictedColumns(rows, role, reportId) { ... }
```

---

### 3.5 `drillDownResolver.js` — Contract

The drill-down is the mechanism that guarantees every number is explainable.

```js
/**
 * Maps a KPI click to a detail query.
 *
 * @param {Object} ctx
 * @param {string} ctx.reportId    — e.g., 'H-05'
 * @param {string} ctx.kpiKey      — e.g., 'lateArrivals'
 * @param {Object} ctx.filters     — Applied report filters (date, dept, etc.)
 * @param {Object} ctx.user        — Current user (for permission scope)
 * @returns {Object}               — { modelName, filter, populate, fields }
 *                                   — Ready to pass to buildReadQuery or buildReport
 */
export function resolveDrillDown(ctx) { ... }
```

**Critical invariant:** The filter produced by `resolveDrillDown` must be identical to the filter used to compute the KPI. If the KPI counted 18 late employees, clicking it must show exactly 18 records — never 17 or 19.

---

### 3.6 `exportGenerator.js` — Contract

```js
/**
 * Generate a file export from report data.
 *
 * @param {Object[]} rows       — Report rows (post column-resolver)
 * @param {Object}   schema     — Column definitions: { key, label, format }
 * @param {string}   format     — 'excel' | 'csv' | 'pdf'
 * @param {Object}   [options]  — PDF: { title, subtitle, logo }
 *                               CSV: { delimiter, lineEnding, headerMap }
 * @returns {Buffer}            — File buffer for HTTP response
 */
export async function generateExport(rows, schema, format, options) { ... }
```

Government-format CSV exports (PF ECR, ESI) define their own `headerMap` object that maps internal field names to the government column names. This decouples format changes from report logic.

---

### 3.7 `cacheLayer.js` — Policy

```js
/**
 * Cache key: `report:${reportId}:${roleId}:${hash(filters)}`
 * TTL: per-report configuration (see individual report specs)
 *
 * Invalidation strategy:
 * - Model create/update events clear relevant report caches via event tags
 * - Example: employee.create → invalidates 'report:H-01:*'
 * - Salary reports (H-15, H-02): manual invalidation on PayrollRun status change
 *
 * Rules:
 * - KPI card results: cacheable (see per-report TTL)
 * - Detail table rows: NOT cacheable for salary/statutory reports
 * - Export results: never cached (always fresh)
 */
```

---

## 4. Security Architecture

### 4.1 Permission Levels
```
Report Level    — Can the user access this report at all?
                  (controlled by role capability / menu visibility)
Row Level       — Which records does the user see?
                  (isSelf, isManagedBy, clientId match)
Column Level    — Which fields appear in the result?
                  (salary, account details, PAN, etc.)
```

**Rule:** The backend is the sole enforcer. The frontend renders what it receives. Frontend must never make visibility decisions for security-sensitive data.

### 4.2 Role-to-Access Matrix (Summary)

| Role | Salary Data | All Employees | Team Only | Self Only |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Superadmin | ✓ | ✓ | — | — |
| HR | ✓ | ✓ | — | — |
| Finance | ✓ (cost only) | ✓ (summary) | — | — |
| Manager | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | — |
| Employee | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |

### 4.3 No Second Permission System
Reports reuse the existing `accessPolicies` / `policyEngine.js` framework. A separate "reporting permission" table must NOT be introduced. The `permissionResolver.js` reads from existing policy records.

---

## 5. API Design

### Endpoint Contract

```
POST /api/reports/:module/:reportId
     Body: { filters, groupBy, type, sort, limit, skip }
     Returns: { kpis, breakdown, rows, meta }

GET  /api/reports/:module/:reportId/export
     Query: format=excel|csv|pdf
     Returns: File buffer (Content-Disposition: attachment)
```

### Response Shape
```json
{
  "meta": {
    "reportId": "H-05",
    "reportName": "Daily Attendance",
    "generatedAt": "2026-07-23T05:00:00Z",
    "totalRows": 142,
    "appliedFilters": { "date": "2026-07-23", "department": null },
    "userScope": "all"
  },
  "kpis": [
    { "key": "totalPresent", "label": "Total Present", "value": 98, "drillDownKey": "present" },
    { "key": "lateArrivals", "label": "Late Arrivals", "value": 18, "drillDownKey": "late" }
  ],
  "breakdown": [
    { "_id": "Engineering", "present": 34, "absent": 2, "late": 5 }
  ],
  "rows": [ ... ]
}
```

**`drillDownKey`** — the frontend passes this back to `/api/reports/:module/:reportId/drilldown` to get the filtered detail list. The backend reconstructs the filter from the key — the frontend does not construct filters.

---

## 6. Report Registry

Every report is declared in a central registry (`src/reportEngine/reportRegistry.js`):

```js
export const REPORT_REGISTRY = {
  'H-05': {
    name: 'Daily Attendance',
    module: 'hrms',
    category: 'attendance',
    primaryModel: 'attendances',
    joins: ['employees'],
    defaultDateField: 'date',
    allowedRoles: ['superadmin', 'hr', 'manager', 'employee'],
    rowScope: {
      manager: 'isManagedBy',
      employee: 'isSelf'
    },
    restrictedColumns: {
      salary: ['Finance', 'HR']    // column: [roles that CAN see it]
    },
    kpis: [
      { key: 'totalPresent', label: 'Total Present', filter: { status: 'Present' } },
      { key: 'lateArrivals', label: 'Late Arrivals', filter: { lateMinutes: { $gt: 0 } } }
    ],
    exports: ['excel', 'csv', 'pdf', 'print'],
    cacheTTL: 120   // seconds
  },
  // ... all other reports
};
```

This registry is the single configuration file for the entire reporting system. It replaces ad-hoc per-report configuration scattered across the codebase.

---

## 7. Implementation Priority

| Priority | Reports | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| P0 — Critical | H-05 Daily Attendance, H-15 Payroll Register, H-18 PF ECR, H-16 My Payslips | Operational daily use + statutory compliance |
| P1 — High | H-01 Headcount, H-06 Attendance Summary, H-11 Leave Summary, C-07 Receivables Aging, HD-01 Ticket Summary | Core management visibility |
| P2 — Important | H-04 Lifecycle Audit, H-22 Onboarding SLA, T-01 Task Summary, T-02 Overdue Tasks, A-01 Asset Register, A-04 Unreturned Assets | Operational safety and audit |
| P3 — Standard | Remaining core reports across all modules | Full system coverage |
| P4 — Additional | All `[ADDITIONAL]` reports | Enhanced visibility after core coverage |

---

## 8. Consistency Rules

These rules are non-negotiable across all module reports:

1. **Single attendance source:** `computeAttendanceSummary()` (from `payrollEngine.js`) is the only function that may compute `presentDays`, `absentDays`, and `lopDays`. Both Payroll and Attendance reports must call this function — never re-implement it.

2. **Payroll data immutability:** All payroll reports (H-15, H-16, H-17, H-18, H-19) read from `Payroll.earnedBreakdown` (frozen at compute time). They must never recalculate earnings from `SalaryStructure` — that data may have changed since the payroll run.

3. **Status values from StatusConfig:** No report hardcodes status values like `'Completed'` or `'Approved'`. Status filter options must be loaded from the `statusconfigs` collection for the relevant model. This ensures reports remain accurate when statuses are reconfigured.

4. **Drill-down count invariance:** The count in a KPI card must always equal the count of records returned by its drill-down. The aggregation pipeline that produced the KPI count and the filter that generates the drill-down list must be derived from the same source filter — enforced by `drillDownResolver`.

5. **No report-specific MongoDB queries:** No controller or route handler may write a custom `Model.aggregate()` or `Model.find()` for a report. All queries go through `buildReport()`. This is the architectural guarantee of consistency.

---

## 9. Success Criteria

The reporting system is considered complete when:

- [ ] Every P0 report is functional, tested, and role-permission verified.
- [ ] Every KPI card on every report has a working drill-down to individual records.
- [ ] Every report with salary data rejects requests from non-Finance/HR roles at the API layer.
- [ ] PF ECR and ESI CSV exports match government-mandated column formats.
- [ ] A manager seeing 18 "Late Arrivals" clicks the card and sees exactly 18 employee records.
- [ ] The payroll register and the attendance summary show identical `presentDays` for the same employee and month.
- [ ] No report duplicates another report's business question (merged or removed per spec).
- [ ] The report registry is the single source of truth — no report configuration exists outside it.


# HRMS-Reporting-Plan.md

> **Module:** HRMS (Human Resource Management System)
> **Version:** 1.0 — July 2026
> **Covers:** Employees · Attendance · Leave · Payroll · Recruitment · Onboarding
> **Source Models:** `Employee`, `EmployeeLifecycleHistory`, `Attendance`, `Leave`, `LeaveTypes`, `LeavePolicy`, `LeaveTransaction`, `Regularization`, `Shift`, `Payroll`, `PayrollRun`, `SalaryStructure`, `Holiday`, `Onboarding`, `OnboardingTemplate`, `Candidate`, `JobOpening`, `WFHRequest`, `CompOffRequest`

---

## 1. Module Overview

### Purpose
HRMS is the foundational people-management module of Tracker. Every employee's complete career record — hire through separation — lives here, along with daily attendance, leave balances, salary computation, and onboarding progress. Payroll is computed from HRMS data combined with Attendance records; statutory compliance reports are generated from the same source.

### Business Goals
- Ensure every HR decision is backed by a factual, auditable record.
- Give managers real-time visibility into their team's availability and cost without routing through HR.
- Allow Finance to reconcile payroll cost precisely against department budgets.
- Provide statutory export files ready for direct government portal upload.

### Reporting Goals
1. Replace all ad-hoc Excel exports — HR can answer any workforce query directly in Tracker.
2. Make payroll computation fully auditable from input (attendance) to output (payslip).
3. Surface attendance anomalies to managers before they become policy violations.
4. Provide statutory exports (PF ECR, ESI, TDS) in government-mandated formats.

## 5. Backend Requirements

### `buildReport()` Features Required for HRMS

| Feature | Reports | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Date range filter on configurable field (`dateField` param) | H-05, H-06, H-08, H-11, H-15 | Critical |
| Row-level scoping (`isSelf`, `isManagedBy`) | H-05, H-06, H-11, H-12, H-16 | Critical |
| Column-level permission stripping | H-02, H-03, H-15 (salary columns) | Critical |
| Cross-model aggregation (Employee + Attendance join) | H-05, H-06, H-08 | Critical |
| `groupBy` aggregation with `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG` | H-01, H-02, H-06, H-09, H-11 | Critical |
| Matrix / pivot layout (employee × day) | H-08 | High |
| Government-format CSV generation | H-18, H-19 | High |
| PDF payslip generation (formatted) | H-16 | High |
| Saved filter presets (no separate report) | H-09 dept view | Medium |

### Shared Services Required

```
src/reportEngine/
├── aggregationEngine.js     — SUM/COUNT/AVG with groupBy, subGroupBy, date bucketing
├── permissionResolver.js    — Resolves role → allowed rows (ABAC) and allowed columns
├── columnResolver.js        — Strips restricted columns before sending response
├── dateRangeResolver.js     — Converts { startDate, endDate, dateField } → $match stage
├── drillDownResolver.js     — Maps { reportId, kpiKey, filterContext } → detail query
├── exportGenerator.js       — Adapters: Excel (xlsx), CSV (custom schema), PDF (pdfkit)
└── cacheLayer.js            — TTL-based result cache keyed by reportId+filters+roleId
```

### Caching Policy
| Report | Cache TTL | Invalidation Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| H-01 KPI cards | 5 min | Employee create/update |
| H-05 KPI cards | 2 min | Attendance punch event |
| H-06 Summary | 15 min | Attendance create/update |
| H-15 Payroll Register | 30 min | PayrollRun status change |
| H-12 Leave Balance | 10 min | LeaveTransaction create |

> **Rule:** KPI card counts may be cached. Detail table rows must never be served from stale cache for salary/statutory reports.

### Consistency Guarantee (Critical)
`computeAttendanceSummary()` in `payrollEngine.js` must be extracted as a **shared service** callable by both the Payroll computation engine AND reports H-06 / H-08. This is the single source of truth for `presentDays`, `absentDays`, and `lopDays`. If reports recalculate these independently, values will drift from what Payroll used — a critical consistency violation.

### Drill-Down Contract
Every KPI card click passes `{ reportId, kpiKey, appliedFilters }` to `drillDownResolver`. The resolver maps this to a predefined detail query (not ad-hoc frontend filtering). This guarantees: **the number in the KPI always equals the count of records in the drill-down list.**

### API Design
```
POST   /api/reports/hrms/:reportId          — All HRMS reports (data)
GET    /api/reports/hrms/:reportId/export   — Export (format=excel|csv|pdf)
GET    /api/reports/hrms/payslip/:payrollId/pdf  — Streaming PDF payslip (separate endpoint)
GET    /api/reports/hrms/ecr/:month/:year/csv    — PF ECR (synchronous, no pagination)
GET    /api/reports/hrms/esi/:month/:year/csv    — ESI return (synchronous)
```

---

## 6. Future Considerations (Architecture Only)

1. **Payroll Archive Partitioning:** After 3 years of `payrolls` × employee count, consider time-partitioned collections or Atlas Online Archive to keep report queries performant.
2. **Daily Attendance Pre-Aggregation Cron:** A nightly job that writes pre-computed `AttendanceDailySummary` documents eliminates expensive real-time aggregation for H-06 and H-08 during month-end peak usage.
3. **Statutory Template Registry:** PF ECR and ESI return formats change with government circulars. A version-stamped `statutoryTemplates` config collection decouples format changes from code deploys.
4. **Report Subscription / Scheduling:** Allow HR to schedule H-15 Payroll Register and H-22 Onboarding SLA as auto-delivered email PDFs on a monthly/daily cron. Reuses `exportGenerator` + existing notification infrastructure.
5. **Salary-Report Access Audit Log:** Record every access to H-02, H-15, H-17, H-18 — who, when, with what filters — stored in `AuditLog`. Required for compliance in regulated industries.


# Tasks-Reporting-Plan.md

> **Module:** Tasks
> **Version:** 1.0 — July 2026
> **Covers:** Tasks · Sprints · Time Tracking · Daily Activity
> **Source Models:** `Tasks`, `Sprint`, `MileStone`, `TimeTrackerSession`, `DailyActivity`, `TaskType`, `Client`, `Employee`

---

## 1. Module Overview

### Purpose
The Tasks module is the operational work-execution backbone of Tracker. Every unit of work — whether a client deliverable, internal project task, or sprint story — is tracked here from creation to closure. Reports from this module answer the fundamental question: **Is work getting done, by whom, on time?**

### Business Goals
- Give managers visibility into team workload and delivery velocity.
- Identify bottlenecks before they impact client commitments.
- Provide accurate time-effort data for billing and productivity analysis.
- Track sprint velocity over time for capacity planning.

### Reporting Goals
1. Give a manager a complete picture of their team's task health in under 2 minutes.
2. Identify overdue tasks before the deadline passes — not after.
3. Provide client-level task summaries for account management.
4. Make sprint velocity measurable across runs.

## 5. Backend Requirements

### `buildReport()` Features Required

| Feature | Reports |
|---|---|
| Date range filter on `dueDate`, `createdAt`, `completedAt` | T-01, T-02, T-07 |
| `groupBy` with `COUNT` | T-01, T-03, T-06, T-09 |
| Row-level scope by `assignedTo` ∈ `managedEmployees` | T-01, T-02, T-06, T-07, T-08 |
| `isSelf` scope | T-05 |
| Date-bucketed aggregation (daily) | T-04 burndown |
| Cross-model join: Tasks + TimeTrackerSession | T-08 |
| Cross-model join: Tasks + Sprint | T-03, T-04 |

### Computed Fields Required (Not Stored)
- `daysOverdue`: `TODAY - dueDate` where `status ≠ Completed` and `dueDate < TODAY`
- `daysInCurrentStatus`: `TODAY - lastStatusChangeDate`
- `velocity %`: `completedCount / totalCount * 100`

These must be computed server-side in the aggregation pipeline — never in the frontend.

### API Design
```
POST /api/reports/tasks/:reportId    — Data query
GET  /api/reports/tasks/:reportId/export  — Export
```

### Performance Considerations
- Index: `tasks.assignedTo`, `tasks.dueDate`, `tasks.status`, `tasks.sprintId`, `tasks.clientId`
- Overdue tasks (T-02) should use a compound index: `{ dueDate: 1, status: 1 }`
- Sprint burndown (T-04) must pre-compute daily snapshots via cron — real-time aggregation per day is too expensive for large sprints

---

## 6. Future Considerations (Architecture Only)

1. **Daily Task Snapshot Cron:** A nightly job that records task counts by status per day enables accurate burndown charts and trend analysis without expensive historical re-aggregation.
2. **Billable Hours Flag:** Add `isBillable` boolean to `TimeTrackerSession` once billing module is introduced. T-08 already has the column slot.
3. **Milestone Progress Report:** Once `MileStone` model is populated, add a Milestone delivery report showing % completion toward key project milestones.


# Helpdesk-Reporting-Plan.md

> **Module:** Helpdesk (Tickets)
> **Version:** 1.0 — July 2026
> **Covers:** Tickets · Comments · Assignments · SLA · Status History
> **Source Models:** `Ticket`, `TicketComment`, `TicketActivityLog`, `TicketAssignment`, `TicketStatusHistory`, `TicketParticipant`, `TicketAttachment`, `Employee`, `Client`, `Agent`

---

## 1. Module Overview

### Purpose
The Helpdesk module is the client-facing support layer of Tracker. Clients raise tickets through the mobile app or web portal; internal developers and support staff resolve them. Every customer issue from open to closed lives here — with full audit history, comment threads, SLA tracking, and developer task linkage.

### Business Goals
- Ensure every client-raised issue is acknowledged, tracked, and resolved with measurable SLA.
- Give management visibility into team workload and resolution performance.
- Identify systemic issues (high-volume ticket types, repeat clients) for root-cause action.
- Provide clients with confidence that their issues are actively managed.

### Reporting Goals
1. Make SLA compliance a measurable daily metric — not an end-of-month surprise.
2. Surface tickets at risk of SLA breach before they breach.
3. Allow account managers to see ticket health per client.
4. Give developers a personal queue view without exposing other users' data.

## 5. Backend Requirements

### `buildReport()` Features Required

| Feature | Reports |
|---|---|
| Date range filter on `createdAt`, `resolvedAt`, `updatedAt` | HD-01, HD-02, HD-08, HD-09, HD-10 |
| Row-level scope by `assignedTo` ∈ `managedEmployees` | HD-01, HD-05, HD-07 |
| `isSelf` scope (`assignedTo = currentUser`) | HD-06 |
| Cross-model join: Ticket + TicketComment (first comment) | HD-08 |
| Cross-model join: Ticket + TicketStatusHistory | HD-07 (days in status) |
| Computed field: `daysOpen = TODAY - createdAt` | HD-07, HD-04 |
| Computed field: `firstResponseTime = firstComment.createdAt - ticket.createdAt` | HD-08 |
| Computed field: `resolutionTime = resolvedAt - createdAt` | HD-02, HD-09 |
| Grouping + aggregation by client | HD-03, HD-04 |
| Time-bucket aggregation (daily/weekly/monthly) | HD-10 |

### SLA Policy Integration
SLA targets (hours) must be read from `GeneralSettings.slaPolicy` (or a dedicated `SLAPolicy` config), not hardcoded. The `buildReport()` engine joins this config at query time to compute SLA compliance per ticket.

### API Design
```
POST /api/reports/helpdesk/:reportId
GET  /api/reports/helpdesk/:reportId/export
```

### Performance Considerations
- Index: `tickets.assignedTo`, `tickets.status`, `tickets.createdAt`, `tickets.clientId`, `tickets.priority`
- Compound index for SLA queries: `{ createdAt: 1, resolvedAt: 1, priority: 1 }`
- First response time (HD-08) requires a lookup into `ticketcomments` — ensure `{ ticketId: 1, createdAt: 1, commenterModel: 1 }` index exists

---

## 6. Future Considerations (Architecture Only)

1. **SLA Policy Model:** Introduce a dedicated `SLAPolicy` model with `priority → targetHours` mapping, configurable per client. This enables per-client SLA agreements without code changes.
2. **Ticket Category Taxonomy:** Once ticket volume grows, a structured `Category → Subcategory` hierarchy on `Ticket` enables richer trend analysis (e.g., "Login issues" vs "Billing queries").
3. **Client Portal Reporting:** A read-only ticket status report accessible to client contacts directly — showing only their own company's ticket summary — built on the same `buildReport()` engine with `clientId`-scoped row policy.
4. **Escalation SLA Alerts:** A cron that checks tickets approaching SLA breach threshold (80% of time elapsed) and fires notifications through the existing `NotificationRule` infrastructure — not a new report, but uses SLA data computed here.


# Assets-Reporting-Plan.md

> **Module:** Assets (Asset Management)
> **Version:** 1.0 — July 2026
> **Covers:** Asset Register · Allocations · Incidents · Repairs · Purchases · Stock Ledger
> **Source Models:** `Asset`, `AssetAllocation`, `AssetIncident`, `AssetRepair`, `AssetCategory`, `AssetVendor`, `AssetPurchase`, `AssetInvoice`, `AssetPayment`, `AssetStockLedger`, `Employee`

---

## 1. Module Overview

### Purpose
The Assets module tracks the full lifecycle of every physical asset owned by the organization — from purchase order to disposal. It connects procurement (purchases, vendors), operations (allocations, repairs), compliance (damage recovery, insurance), and finance (asset cost, vendor payments). Reports from this module answer: **Where is every asset, who has it, what condition is it in, and what has it cost us?**

### Business Goals
- Maintain a 100% accurate real-time asset register — zero untracked assets.
- Ensure all allocated assets are with the correct employee and in documented condition.
- Track financial exposure from damage incidents and repair costs.
- Provide purchase history for budget forecasting and vendor performance.

### Reporting Goals
1. Enable an Admin to verify every asset's location and custodian in seconds.
2. Surface assets that are damaged, under repair, or lost so management can act.
3. Provide Finance with asset purchase costs and depreciation visibility.
4. Make the employee exit process safer by flagging unreturned assets.

## 5. Backend Requirements

### `buildReport()` Features Required

| Feature | Reports |
|---|---|
| Cross-model join: Asset + AssetAllocation | A-01, A-03, A-04, A-06 |
| Cross-model join: Asset + AssetIncident | A-07 |
| Cross-model join: Asset + AssetRepair | A-08 |
| Cross-model join: AssetAllocation + Employee (status) | A-04 |
| Row-level scope (`isManagedBy`) | A-03, A-04, A-06 |
| `isSelf` scope | A-06 (employee self-view) |
| Date range filter on `allocationDate`, `sentDate`, `purchaseDate` | A-03, A-08, A-10 |
| Aggregation with `SUM` (recovery amount, purchase cost) | A-07, A-09, A-10 |
| Computed field: `daysInRepair = TODAY - sentDate` | A-08 |
| Computed field: `daysSinceSeparation = TODAY - lastWorkingDay` | A-04 |
| `groupBy` category/status | A-02, A-10 |

### A-04 Special Logic (Unreturned Assets)
This report requires a cross-model join across:
1. `assetallocations` (status = Active)
2. `employees` (status ∈ [Resigned, Terminated, On Notice])

The engine must NOT rely on a single collection. This is a declarative multi-model join that `buildReport()` must support via `$lookup` pipeline stages.

### API Design
```
POST /api/reports/assets/:reportId
GET  /api/reports/assets/:reportId/export
```

### Performance Considerations
- Index: `assetallocations.status`, `assetallocations.employeeId`, `assets.status`, `assets.category`
- A-04 (Unreturned Assets) requires compound index: `{ status: 1, employeeId: 1 }` on `assetallocations`
- A-08 (Active Repairs): `{ status: 1, sentDate: 1 }` on `assetrepairs`

---

## 6. Future Considerations (Architecture Only)

1. **Asset Depreciation Engine:** Add a computed `currentValue` field based on purchase cost, asset age, and a configurable depreciation rate per category. This enables a Balance Sheet–level Asset Valuation report for Finance without manual calculation.
2. **QR Code / Barcode Integration:** Link each `Asset._id` to a QR code for mobile scan-based stock verification. The `AssetStockLedger` audit trail already supports this; only the scanning UI needs to be added.
3. **Warranty Expiry Notifications:** A cron checking `asset.warrantyExpiry` within 30/60/90 days and firing notifications through the existing `NotificationRule` infrastructure — no separate report needed, uses existing data.
4. **Insurance Tracking:** Add an `insurance` subdocument to `Asset` (insurer, policy number, premium, expiry) to enable an Insurance Expiry report for Admin/Finance.


# CRM-Reporting-Plan.md

> **Module:** CRM (Client Relationship Management)
> **Version:** 1.0 — July 2026
> **Covers:** Clients · Contacts · Leads · Quotations · Orders · Activities · Meetings · Collections
> **Source Models:** `Client`, `Contact`, `CRMActivity`, `CRMMeeting`, `Quotation`, `QuotationRevision`, `OrderAcknowledgment`, `Collection`, `Payment`, `PaymentJournal`, `ClientLedger`, `Expense`

---

## 1. Module Overview

### Purpose
The CRM module captures and tracks the entire client-facing commercial pipeline — from first contact through quotation, order confirmation, delivery, and payment collection. It sits at the intersection of Sales (new opportunities), Operations (active client delivery), and Finance (collections and receivables). Reports from this module answer: **Is our pipeline healthy, are we closing business, and are clients paying on time?**

### Business Goals
- Give sales and account managers complete visibility into their pipeline and client activity.
- Ensure no quotation expires or goes unfollowed.
- Track collections against invoices to surface overdue receivables before they age.
- Measure sales team activity and effectiveness objectively.

### Reporting Goals
1. Replace pipeline spreadsheets — one report shows the full sales pipeline.
2. Make overdue collections visible daily — Finance should not discover aged receivables at month-end.
3. Measure sales rep activity (calls, meetings, follow-ups) to support performance management.
4. Provide Finance with a receivables aging report for working capital decisions.

## 5. Backend Requirements

### `buildReport()` Features Required

| Feature | Reports |
|---|---|
| Date range on `quotationDate`, `orderDate`, `paymentDate` | C-01, C-02, C-08, C-09 |
| Cross-model join: Quotation + OrderAcknowledgment (conversion tracking) | C-11 |
| Cross-model join: Collection + Payment + ClientLedger | C-04, C-07, C-08 |
| Aging bucket computation (0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 90+) | C-07 |
| Grouping by client with multi-metric aggregation | C-03, C-05, C-07, C-08 |
| Row-level scope by `assignedTo` (sales rep's own clients) | C-01, C-03, C-10 |
| Computed field: `daysOverdue = TODAY - dueDate` | C-07 |
| Computed field: `conversionRate = accepted / sent` | C-11 |
| Running balance computation (ledger) | C-04 |

### Aging Buckets (C-07 Implementation)
Aging must be computed server-side:
```js
daysOverdue = Math.floor((today - dueDate) / 86400000)
bucket = daysOverdue <= 0 ? 'Current' :
         daysOverdue <= 30 ? '1-30' :
         daysOverdue <= 60 ? '31-60' :
         daysOverdue <= 90 ? '61-90' : '90+'
```
This logic belongs in `aggregationEngine.js` as a reusable `$addFields` stage builder, not in individual report implementations.

### API Design
```
POST /api/reports/crm/:reportId
GET  /api/reports/crm/:reportId/export
```

### Performance Considerations
- Index: `quotations.status`, `quotations.assignedTo`, `quotations.expiryDate`
- Index: `collections.clientId`, `collections.dueDate`, `collections.paymentStatus`
- C-07 Receivables Aging runs daily for Finance; cache result for 30 minutes with invalidation on any payment event

## 6. Future Considerations (Architecture Only)

1. **Revenue Forecast:** Once order intake data is stable, add a monthly revenue projection report based on confirmed orders with expected delivery dates — no assumptions, only confirmed records.
2. **Credit Limit Integration:** If a `creditLimit` field is added to `Client`, the Receivables Aging report can add a "% of Credit Limit Used" column to flag clients near their limit.
3. **Lead Source Tracking:** Adding a `leadSource` field to `Client` / opportunity model enables a Lead Conversion by Source report, which is currently not possible without source data.
4. **Client Segmentation:** A `tier` or `segment` field on `Client` (e.g., Key Account / Growth / Standard) enables portfolio-level reporting without custom SQL queries.


# People-Reporting-Plan.md

> **Module:** People (Travel, Expenses & Daily Activity)
> **Version:** 1.0 — July 2026
> **Covers:** Expenses · WFH Requests · Daily Activity Logs · Employee Self-Service
> **Source Models:** `Expense`, `WFHRequest`, `DailyActivity`, `Employee`, `Client`, `Department`

## 1. Module Overview

### Purpose
The People module captures the day-to-day self-reported activity of employees — expenses claimed for business travel and operations, requests to work from home, and daily activity logs (what did I work on today). These records are submitted by employees and approved through the standard approval workflow. Reports from this module answer: **Are employees claiming expenses appropriately, working from home by policy, and logging their daily output?**

### Business Goals
- Ensure expense claims are legitimate, within policy, and accurately reimbursed.
- Maintain visibility into WFH patterns across the organization.
- Provide Finance with expense accruals for cost control.
- Give managers transparency into what their team is working on daily.

### Reporting Goals
1. Give Finance a monthly expense summary ready for reimbursement processing.
2. Surface expense policy violations before they are reimbursed.
3. Give managers a team-level view of WFH usage.
4. Provide HR with daily activity data as an operational productivity signal.

## 5. Backend Requirements

### `buildReport()` Features Required

| Feature | Reports |
|---|---|
| Date range on `expenseDate`, `wfhDate`, `activityDate` | P-01, P-06, P-08 |
| Row-level scope (`isManagedBy`, `isSelf`) | All reports |
| Aggregation `SUM(amount)` by employee/category/dept | P-01, P-03, P-04 |
| Cross-model join: DailyActivity + Client | P-09 |
| Computed field: `daysOverdue = TODAY - submittedDate` | P-02 |
| Policy limit comparison (expense ceiling per category) | P-05 |
| Time-bucket grouping (monthly) | P-07 |

### Expense Policy Config
P-05 (Expense Exceptions) requires a `ExpensePolicy` config (or stored in `GeneralSettings`) defining per-category spending limits. This is a **configuration read**, not hardcoded logic. The `columnResolver` / `aggregationEngine` must join this config at query time.

### API Design
```
POST /api/reports/people/:reportId
GET  /api/reports/people/:reportId/export
```

## 6. Future Considerations (Architecture Only)

1. **Expense Receipt OCR:** When receipt attachments are added to `Expense`, an OCR pipeline could validate that claimed amounts match the attached receipt — purely data verification, not AI inference.
2. **WFH Policy Enforcement:** If a `wfhAllowance` (days per month) is added to `LeavePolicy`, the WFH Summary report can automatically flag employees who exceeded their monthly WFH quota — no new report needed, just an additional column.
3. **Daily Activity Completeness Cron:** A daily cron that checks which employees submitted no activity log for the previous working day and fires a reminder notification — reuses existing notification infrastructure.
