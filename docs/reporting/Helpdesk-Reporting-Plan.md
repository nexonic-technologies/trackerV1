## 1. Module Overview

### Purpose
The Helpdesk module is the client-facing support layer of Tracker. Clients raise tickets through the mobile app or web portal; internal developers and support staff resolve them. Every customer issue from open to closed lives here — with full audit history, comment threads, SLA tracking, and developer task linkage.

### Business Goals
- Ensure every client-raised issue is acknowledged, tracked, and resolved with measurable SLA.
- Give management visibility into team workload and resolution performance.
- Identify systemic issues (high-volume ticket types, repeat clients) for root-cause action.
- Provide clients with confidence that their issues are actively managed.

### Reporting Goals
1. Make SLA compliance a measurable daily metric — not an end-of-month surprise.
2. Surface tickets at risk of SLA breach before they breach.
3. Allow account managers to see ticket health per client.
4. Give developers a personal queue view without exposing other users' data.

## 5. Backend Requirements

### `buildReport()` Features Required

| Feature | Reports |
|---|---|
| Date range filter on `createdAt`, `resolvedAt`, `updatedAt` | HD-01, HD-02, HD-08, HD-09, HD-10 |
| Row-level scope by `assignedTo` ∈ `managedEmployees` | HD-01, HD-05, HD-07 |
| `isSelf` scope (`assignedTo = currentUser`) | HD-06 |
| Cross-model join: Ticket + TicketComment (first comment) | HD-08 |
| Cross-model join: Ticket + TicketStatusHistory | HD-07 (days in status) |
| Computed field: `daysOpen = TODAY - createdAt` | HD-07, HD-04 |
| Computed field: `firstResponseTime = firstComment.createdAt - ticket.createdAt` | HD-08 |
| Computed field: `resolutionTime = resolvedAt - createdAt` | HD-02, HD-09 |
| Grouping + aggregation by client | HD-03, HD-04 |
| Time-bucket aggregation (daily/weekly/monthly) | HD-10 |

### SLA Policy Integration
SLA targets (hours) must be read from `GeneralSettings.slaPolicy` (or a dedicated `SLAPolicy` config), not hardcoded. The `buildReport()` engine joins this config at query time to compute SLA compliance per ticket.

### API Design
```
POST /api/reports/helpdesk/:reportId
GET  /api/reports/helpdesk/:reportId/export
```

### Performance Considerations
- Index: `tickets.assignedTo`, `tickets.status`, `tickets.createdAt`, `tickets.clientId`, `tickets.priority`
- Compound index for SLA queries: `{ createdAt: 1, resolvedAt: 1, priority: 1 }`
- First response time (HD-08) requires a lookup into `ticketcomments` — ensure `{ ticketId: 1, createdAt: 1, commenterModel: 1 }` index exists

---

## 6. Future Considerations (Architecture Only)

1. **SLA Policy Model:** Introduce a dedicated `SLAPolicy` model with `priority → targetHours` mapping, configurable per client. This enables per-client SLA agreements without code changes.
2. **Ticket Category Taxonomy:** Once ticket volume grows, a structured `Category → Subcategory` hierarchy on `Ticket` enables richer trend analysis (e.g., "Login issues" vs "Billing queries").
3. **Client Portal Reporting:** A read-only ticket status report accessible to client contacts directly — showing only their own company's ticket summary — built on the same `buildReport()` engine with `clientId`-scoped row policy.
4. **Escalation SLA Alerts:** A cron that checks tickets approaching SLA breach threshold (80% of time elapsed) and fires notifications through the existing `NotificationRule` infrastructure — not a new report, but uses SLA data computed here.
