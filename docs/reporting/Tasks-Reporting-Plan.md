## 1. Module Overview

### Purpose
The Tasks module is the operational work-execution backbone of Tracker. Every unit of work — whether a client deliverable, internal project task, or sprint story — is tracked here from creation to closure. Reports from this module answer the fundamental question: **Is work getting done, by whom, on time?**

### Business Goals
- Give managers visibility into team workload and delivery velocity.
- Identify bottlenecks before they impact client commitments.
- Provide accurate time-effort data for billing and productivity analysis.
- Track sprint velocity over time for capacity planning.

### Reporting Goals
1. Give a manager a complete picture of their team's task health in under 2 minutes.
2. Identify overdue tasks before the deadline passes — not after.
3. Provide client-level task summaries for account management.
4. Make sprint velocity measurable across runs.

## 5. Backend Requirements

### `buildReport()` Features Required

| Feature | Reports |
|---|---|
| Date range filter on `dueDate`, `createdAt`, `completedAt` | T-01, T-02, T-07 |
| `groupBy` with `COUNT` | T-01, T-03, T-06, T-09 |
| Row-level scope by `assignedTo` ∈ `managedEmployees` | T-01, T-02, T-06, T-07, T-08 |
| `isSelf` scope | T-05 |
| Date-bucketed aggregation (daily) | T-04 burndown |
| Cross-model join: Tasks + TimeTrackerSession | T-08 |
| Cross-model join: Tasks + Sprint | T-03, T-04 |

### Computed Fields Required (Not Stored)
- `daysOverdue`: `TODAY - dueDate` where `status ≠ Completed` and `dueDate < TODAY`
- `daysInCurrentStatus`: `TODAY - lastStatusChangeDate`
- `velocity %`: `completedCount / totalCount * 100`

These must be computed server-side in the aggregation pipeline — never in the frontend.

### API Design
```
POST /api/reports/tasks/:reportId    — Data query
GET  /api/reports/tasks/:reportId/export  — Export
```

### Performance Considerations
- Index: `tasks.assignedTo`, `tasks.dueDate`, `tasks.status`, `tasks.sprintId`, `tasks.clientId`
- Overdue tasks (T-02) should use a compound index: `{ dueDate: 1, status: 1 }`
- Sprint burndown (T-04) must pre-compute daily snapshots via cron — real-time aggregation per day is too expensive for large sprints

---

## 6. Future Considerations (Architecture Only)

1. **Daily Task Snapshot Cron:** A nightly job that records task counts by status per day enables accurate burndown charts and trend analysis without expensive historical re-aggregation.
2. **Billable Hours Flag:** Add `isBillable` boolean to `TimeTrackerSession` once billing module is introduced. T-08 already has the column slot.
3. **Milestone Progress Report:** Once `MileStone` model is populated, add a Milestone delivery report showing % completion toward key project milestones.
