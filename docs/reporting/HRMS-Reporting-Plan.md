## 1. Module Overview

### Purpose
HRMS is the foundational people-management module of Tracker. Every employee's complete career record — hire through separation — lives here, along with daily attendance, leave balances, salary computation, and onboarding progress. Payroll is computed from HRMS data combined with Attendance records; statutory compliance reports are generated from the same source.

### Business Goals
- Ensure every HR decision is backed by a factual, auditable record.
- Give managers real-time visibility into their team's availability and cost without routing through HR.
- Allow Finance to reconcile payroll cost precisely against department budgets.
- Provide statutory export files ready for direct government portal upload.

### Reporting Goals
1. Replace all ad-hoc Excel exports — HR can answer any workforce query directly in Tracker.
2. Make payroll computation fully auditable from input (attendance) to output (payslip).
3. Surface attendance anomalies to managers before they become policy violations.
4. Provide statutory exports (PF ECR, ESI, TDS) in government-mandated formats.

## 5. Backend Requirements

### `buildReport()` Features Required for HRMS

| Feature | Reports | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Date range filter on configurable field (`dateField` param) | H-05, H-06, H-08, H-11, H-15 | Critical |
| Row-level scoping (`isSelf`, `isManagedBy`) | H-05, H-06, H-11, H-12, H-16 | Critical |
| Column-level permission stripping | H-02, H-03, H-15 (salary columns) | Critical |
| Cross-model aggregation (Employee + Attendance join) | H-05, H-06, H-08 | Critical |
| `groupBy` aggregation with `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG` | H-01, H-02, H-06, H-09, H-11 | Critical |
| Matrix / pivot layout (employee × day) | H-08 | High |
| Government-format CSV generation | H-18, H-19 | High |
| PDF payslip generation (formatted) | H-16 | High |
| Saved filter presets (no separate report) | H-09 dept view | Medium |

### Shared Services Required

```
src/reportEngine/
├── aggregationEngine.js     — SUM/COUNT/AVG with groupBy, subGroupBy, date bucketing
├── permissionResolver.js    — Resolves role → allowed rows (ABAC) and allowed columns
├── columnResolver.js        — Strips restricted columns before sending response
├── dateRangeResolver.js     — Converts { startDate, endDate, dateField } → $match stage
├── drillDownResolver.js     — Maps { reportId, kpiKey, filterContext } → detail query
├── exportGenerator.js       — Adapters: Excel (xlsx), CSV (custom schema), PDF (pdfkit)
└── cacheLayer.js            — TTL-based result cache keyed by reportId+filters+roleId
```

### Caching Policy
| Report | Cache TTL | Invalidation Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| H-01 KPI cards | 5 min | Employee create/update |
| H-05 KPI cards | 2 min | Attendance punch event |
| H-06 Summary | 15 min | Attendance create/update |
| H-15 Payroll Register | 30 min | PayrollRun status change |
| H-12 Leave Balance | 10 min | LeaveTransaction create |

> **Rule:** KPI card counts may be cached. Detail table rows must never be served from stale cache for salary/statutory reports.

### Consistency Guarantee (Critical)
`computeAttendanceSummary()` in `payrollEngine.js` must be extracted as a **shared service** callable by both the Payroll computation engine AND reports H-06 / H-08. This is the single source of truth for `presentDays`, `absentDays`, and `lopDays`. If reports recalculate these independently, values will drift from what Payroll used — a critical consistency violation.

### Drill-Down Contract
Every KPI card click passes `{ reportId, kpiKey, appliedFilters }` to `drillDownResolver`. The resolver maps this to a predefined detail query (not ad-hoc frontend filtering). This guarantees: **the number in the KPI always equals the count of records in the drill-down list.**

### API Design
```
POST   /api/reports/hrms/:reportId          — All HRMS reports (data)
GET    /api/reports/hrms/:reportId/export   — Export (format=excel|csv|pdf)
GET    /api/reports/hrms/payslip/:payrollId/pdf  — Streaming PDF payslip (separate endpoint)
GET    /api/reports/hrms/ecr/:month/:year/csv    — PF ECR (synchronous, no pagination)
GET    /api/reports/hrms/esi/:month/:year/csv    — ESI return (synchronous)
```

## 6. Future Considerations (Architecture Only)

1. **Payroll Archive Partitioning:** After 3 years of `payrolls` × employee count, consider time-partitioned collections or Atlas Online Archive to keep report queries performant.
2. **Daily Attendance Pre-Aggregation Cron:** A nightly job that writes pre-computed `AttendanceDailySummary` documents eliminates expensive real-time aggregation for H-06 and H-08 during month-end peak usage.
3. **Statutory Template Registry:** PF ECR and ESI return formats change with government circulars. A version-stamped `statutoryTemplates` config collection decouples format changes from code deploys.
4. **Report Subscription / Scheduling:** Allow HR to schedule H-15 Payroll Register and H-22 Onboarding SLA as auto-delivered email PDFs on a monthly/daily cron. Reuses `exportGenerator` + existing notification infrastructure.
5. **Salary-Report Access Audit Log:** Record every access to H-02, H-15, H-17, H-18 — who, when, with what filters — stored in `AuditLog`. Required for compliance in regulated industries.
