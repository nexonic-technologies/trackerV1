# Tracker Mongoose Collections Reference
**Scope**: Core Platform Collections (Category, Business Purpose, Wiring, & Extension Guidelines)  
**Status**: Stable Core Schemas  

This document serves as the master architectural reference for Mongoose database collections. It explains why each model exists, what business problems it solves, its relations, UI field groupings, extension boundaries, and governing policies.

## 1. `employees` Collection

### Key Field Groups (UI-Friendly Overview)
(UI-Friendly Overview)
- **Basic Information**: First name, last name, DOB, DOA, marital status, gender, phone, email, profile image.
- **Professional Details**: Employee ID, designation (ref), department (ref), role (ref), reporting manager (ref), team lead (ref), level, DOJ, probation period, confirmation date.
- **Authentication**: Work email, password, password reset tokens.
- **Salary & Bank Details**: Account name, account number, bank name, branch, IFSC code.
- **Salary Breakdown**: CTC package, basic, allowances, deductions.
- **Personal Documents**: PAN card, Aadhar card, and file upload references.

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** The `employees` collection is the foundation of identity and profile data across the system. If it did not exist, mapping attendance records, routing approvals to managers, issuing notifications, or processing monthly payroll runs would be impossible.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It removes the operational pain of fragmented worker profiles. It allows HR managers, team leaders, and payroll engines to access a single, verified record of an employee's professional status, line-manager hierarchy, banking details, and credentials.

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: `departments` (via `professionalInfo.department`), `designations` (via `professionalInfo.designation`), `roles` (via `professionalInfo.role`).
- **[Verified]** **Child / References**: Self-referencing link via `professionalInfo.reportingManager` and `professionalInfo.teamLead`. Referenced by almost all transactional models (e.g. `Attendance`, `Leave`, `Tasks`, `Ticket`, `AssetAllocation`).

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Operational**. It stores mutable, active identity profiles that undergo routine transformations (promotions, contact updates) and trigger active lifecycle hooks.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To act as the master identity directory for the platform. In future releases (such as advanced resource scheduling and AI productivity analysis), it will serve as the source of truth for worker availability and performance metrics.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** Embedding employee profiles inside department or project collections would cause severe data duplication, update anomalies, and slow down access control checks.

### Architectural Importance
**[Architectural Intent]** All access controls, workflows, task assignments, and payroll calculations would break. The system would lose the ability to verify who is performing an action or to whom a notification belongs.

### Extension Guidelines
- **[Recommendation]** **Add Fields Here**: When capturing permanent, cross-module profile parameters (e.g., secondary contact info, work location, or tax status).
- **[Recommendation]** **Create New Collection Instead**: If tracking temporary data or recurring metrics (e.g., monthly performance ratings or daily activity checks).
- **[Verified]** **Service Hooks**: Password hashing (`beforeCreate`/`beforeUpdate`) and exit clearance validation are enforced in [employees.js](file:///E:/Loigmax/Tracker/backend/src/services/employees.js).

### Policies
- **[Verified]** **Soft Delete**: Terminates employees by shifting `status = "Terminated"`. Hard deletion is blocked.
- **[Verified]** **Clearance Lock**: The `beforeUpdate` hook blocks terminations or deactivations if the employee still holds active asset allocations.
- **[Recommendation]** **Security**: Access policies (`AccessPolicies.json`) enforce field-level permissions (e.g., hide passwords and CTC package fields from non-admin roles).

### Known Constraints
UNKNOWN

### Future Recommendations
- **[Recommendation]** *Design Trade-offs*: Bank details and allowances are stored directly in the profile to keep lookups fast. For future releases, a separate bank ledger registry may be recommended for stricter auditing.

## 2. `attendances` Collection

### Key Field Groups (UI-Friendly Overview)
(UI-Friendly Overview)
- **Identity Details**: Employee reference (ref), employee name, manager reference (ref).
- **Logs**: Date, check-in timestamp, check-out timestamp, latitude/longitude coordinates, check-in request text.
- **Computations**: Work hours (calculated), status (e.g. Present, Absent, WFH, LOP, Late Entry).
- **Context Mappings**: Leave type reference (ref) if checking status = `Leave`.

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** To capture employee time-in and time-out data. If it did not exist, payroll runs could not compute LOP deductions, overtime, or attendance ratio balances.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It eliminates manual tracking and prevents time theft. Employees gain a clear check-in terminal, while management gets real-time visibility into attendance ratios and coordinates.

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: `employees` (via `employee` and `managerId`).
- **[Verified]** **Child / References**: `leavetypes` (via `leaveType` ref to associate paid/unpaid leaves).

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Historical**. It stores sequential time logs that cannot be altered retroactively once approved.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To supply accurate calculations data to the payroll engine and compile analytics reports on worker punctuality and presence.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** An employee checks in daily, generating hundreds of records per year. Embedding this inside the `employees` collection would cause documents to hit MongoDB's 16MB document limit.

### Architectural Importance
**[Architectural Intent]** Automated payroll calculations would fail, and LOP deductions would have to be calculated manually from spreadsheets.

### Extension Guidelines
- **[Recommendation]** **Add Fields Here**: When logging check-in telemetry (e.g., client IP address or device fingerprint).
- **[Recommendation]** **Create New Collection Instead**: If capturing detail sub-tasks completed during work hours (use `dailyactivities`).
- **[Verified]** **Service Hooks**: [attendances.js](file:///E:/Loigmax/Tracker/backend/src/services/attendances.js) enforces coordinates tracking and check-in bounds.

### Policies
- **[Verified]** **Approved Month Lock**: Attendance logs for previous months are locked against modifications once the payroll run for that month is `Approved` or `Paid`.
- **[Verified]** **Pre-save Trigger**: Work hours (`workHours`) are automatically computed on save if both `checkIn` and `checkOut` are present.

### Known Constraints
UNKNOWN

### Future Recommendations
- **[Architectural Intent]** *Limitations*: Locations are currently simplified to a single coordinate snapshot. Tracking route paths during WFH shifts is reserved for future releases.

## 3. `payrolls` Collection

### Key Field Groups (UI-Friendly Overview)
(UI-Friendly Overview)
- **Identity Details**: Employee reference (ref), processed by (ref), approved by (ref).
- **Period**: Month, year, payment date.
- **Salary Snapshot**: CTC package, basic salary, total gross earnings, total net deductions, status (e.g. Draft, Computed, Approved, Paid).
- **Breakdown Snapshots**: Earnings breakdown array, deductions breakdown array, statutory deductions.

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** To store computed payroll slips for each employee monthly. It serves as the final financial ledger showing CTC payouts and deductions.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It automates salary computations and maintains billing compliance. It prevents incorrect payouts by snapshotting salary figures at the moment of approval.

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: `employees` (via `employeeId`), `payrollruns` (via parent run ID).
- **[Verified]** **Child / References**: None. It holds static snapshots of figures.

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Financial**. It represents the finalized financial ledger records of the system.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To manage bank transfer exports, statutory compliance filings (PF, ESI), and generate employees payslips.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** It must represent a point-in-time snapshot. Overwriting values in the employee's active profile does not work because historical salary revisions must not retroactively change past payslips.

### Architectural Importance
**[Architectural Intent]** Employees would not have access to past payslips, and compliance auditing of salary structures would be impossible.

### Extension Guidelines
- **[Recommendation]** **Add Fields Here**: When adding new compliance attributes (e.g. tax filing reference numbers).
- **[Recommendation]** **Create New Collection Instead**: If creating dynamic calculation engines (write utility files, not new database schemas).

### Policies
- **[Verified]** **Immutability Lock**: The `beforeUpdate` hook in [payrolls.js](file:///E:/Loigmax/Tracker/backend/src/services/payrolls.js) locks all fields once status transitions to `Approved` or `Paid`.
- **[Recommendation]** **Uniqueness constraint**: Enforces unique combination of `employeeId`, `month`, and `year`.

### Known Constraints
UNKNOWN

### Future Recommendations
- **[Architectural Intent]** *Limitations*: TDS is currently simplified to flat structure values. A statutory compliance tax calculator is planned for future releases.

## 4. `shifts` & `shiftassignments` Collections

### Key Field Groups (UI-Friendly Overview)
(UI-Friendly Overview)
- **Shift Settings**: Shift name, start time ("09:00"), end time ("18:00"), break duration, weekly off days array, overtime threshold.
- **Assignment Mapping**: Target employee (ref), shift ID (ref), effective start date, effective end date, isActive boolean.

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** To track work schedules and map them to employees dynamically. If it did not exist, calculating overtime or determining check-in lateness would be impossible.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It prevents errors in lateness calculations for varying schedules (e.g. night shifts vs. morning shifts).

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: `employees` (via `employeeId` in assignment).
- **[Verified]** **Child / References**: `attendances` (evaluates shift settings during check-in).

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Historical**. It tracks historical changes in shift assignments.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To support dynamic roster scheduling and automated time tracking.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** An employee can change shifts multiple times during their tenure. Storing a single shift ID on the profile would overwrite past assignments, breaking historical calculation audits.

### Architectural Importance
**[Architectural Intent]** Lateness checks and overtime computations would revert to manual spreadsheet processing.

### Business Lifecycle

### Extension Guidelines
- **[Recommendation]** **Add Fields Here**: When capturing shift constraints (e.g., maximum check-in window delay).
- **[Recommendation]** **Create New Collection Instead**: If tracking ad-hoc temporary shift overrides (e.g. swap requests).

### Policies
- **[Verified]** **Transition Lock**: Updating an assignment requires setting `isActive: false` and `endDate: now` on the previous record before saving the new active range.
- **[Recommendation]** **Immutability**: Shifts cannot be modified if they have active assignments linked to processed payroll runs.

### Known Constraints
UNKNOWN

### Future Recommendations
- **[Recommendation]** *Architectural Recommendation*: Introduce a `shifts.js` service to automate the active shift deactivation workflow in future releases.

## 5. `tickets` Collection

### Key Field Groups (UI-Friendly Overview)
(UI-Friendly Overview)
- **Identity Details**: Ticket ID, title, description, user story, project category (ref), target product (ref).
- **Assignments**: Assigned developers array (ref), client reference (ref), creator model type (ref Path).
- **Workflow State**: Priority (Low, Medium, High, Critical), status (Open, Waiting For Admin, Waiting For Client, Resolved, Closed), metaStatus.
- **Sync Context**: Linked task reference (ref), converted by (ref), resolved at timestamp.

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** To manage external customer and client support requests. It separates development tasks from customer-facing issue management.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It keeps clients isolated from internal task tracking while allowing developers to coordinate issues directly with tasks.

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: `clients` (via `clientId`), `employees` / `agents` (via polymorphic `createdBy`).
- **[Verified]** **Child / References**: `tasks` (via `linkedTaskId` ref).

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Workflow**. It drives a multi-stage communication and validation cycle.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To operate as the customer support portal and coordinate service level agreements (SLA) metrics.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** Tickets follow client visibility rules and polymorphic creator schemas (agents/employees) that do not map to the internal development task collection.

### Architectural Importance
**[Architectural Intent]** Customer support tracking would break, and clients would lose visibility into issue resolution progress.

### Policies
- **[Verified]** **Client Isolation**: Client agents can only access tickets belonging to their client ID.
- **[Verified]** **Dynamic Status Mapping**: Task completion triggers automatic ticket resolution via `ticketTaskSync.js`.

### Known Constraints
UNKNOWN

### Future Recommendations
- **[Architectural Intent]** *Limitations*: Status transitions are currently mapped inside service code. Moving these to metadata configurations is a recommended enhancement.

## 6. `tasks` Collection

### Key Field Groups (UI-Friendly Overview)
(UI-Friendly Overview)
- **Metadata**: Task code, title, description, priority.
- **Assignments**: Creator reference (ref), assigned developer reference (ref).
- **Workflow State**: Status (Backlogs, To Do, In Progress, In Review, Completed, Closed).
- **Sync Context**: Linked ticket reference (ref).

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** To track internal development workflows and project milestones.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It prevents team coordination blockages. Developers and managers gain real-time visibility into backlogs and in-progress tasks.

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: `employees` (via creator/assignee).
- **[Verified]** **Child / References**: `tickets` (via `linkedTicketId`).

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Workflow**.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To support automated project reporting and developer productivity metrics.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** Internal tasks contain developer-only details (e.g., impact analysis, internal code links) that should not be visible to client support agents.

### Architectural Importance
**[Architectural Intent]** Internal development progress tracking would be lost.

## 7. `assets` Collection

### Key Field Groups (UI-Friendly Overview)
(UI-Friendly Overview)
- **Identity Details**: Asset ID, category reference (ref), asset name, serial number, IMEI.
- **Procurement**: Purchase reference (ref), purchase cost, vendor name, invoice reference, warranty expiry date.
- **Operational Status**: Status (Available, Allocated, Under Repair, Disposed), condition (Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor, Damaged).
- **Holder Details**: Current allocated employee reference (ref), current allocation reference (ref).

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** To maintain the master register of physical hardware items owned by the organization.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It prevents equipment loss, tracks warranty expirations, and streamlines device assignments.

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: `assetcategories` (via `categoryId`).
- **[Verified]** **Child / References**: Referenced by `assetallocations`, `assetincidents`, and `assetrepairs`.

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Operational**.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To support automated inventory calculations, depreciation reports, and automated device provisioning.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** Assets exist independently of who is holding them. Embedding them in employee records would make it impossible to track unallocated inventory.

### Architectural Importance
**[Architectural Intent]** The organization would lose its inventory control registry, leading to equipment loss and missing compliance audits.

- **Visibility Limits**: Group reference (ref), channel reference (ref).
- **Engagement Details**: Reactions array, comments count, views count, followers array.

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** To operate as the corporate announcement board and social feed.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It replaces fragmented email chains with centralized corporate communications.

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: `employees` (via `author`).
- **[Verified]** **Child / References**: `feedcomments` (via `postId`).

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Operational**.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To drive internal communication, share documents, and manage event schedules.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** Feed posts generate high write/read frequencies and are social, which does not fit inside internal task or profile databases.

## 9. `departments` Collection

### Key Field Groups (UI-Friendly Overview)
(UI-Friendly Overview)
- **Basic Info**: Department name, department short code, description.
- **Governing Policies**: Leave policy reference (ref), attendance policy reference (ref).
- **Leadership**: Department manager reference (ref).

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** The `departments` collection exists to organize the company's employee structure into functional units (e.g., HR, Engineering, Sales). It links these units to specific policies like leave policies and attendance policies, and defines managers for routing approvals. Without it, managing policy applications and approval hierarchies dynamically across groups of employees would be extremely hard.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It removes the operational pain of applying HR and attendance rules to employees individually. It automates policy assignment based on team membership and establishes a clear reporting line for department-wide approval routing.

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: None.
- **[Verified]** **Child / References**: References `leavepolicies` (via `leavePolicy`), `attendancepolicies` (via `attendancePolicy`), and `employees` (via `manager`). Referenced by `employees` (via `professionalInfo.department`) and `HRPolicy` (via `departments`).

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Registry**. It serves as a master lookup table of the organization's corporate structure.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To support dynamic department-based resource allocation, cost center budgeting, granular role-based access control, and dynamic approval routing.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** Departments have independent attributes (manager, policies, codes) that are shared by many employees. Embedding these details inside individual employee records would lead to severe data duplication and update anomalies.

### Architectural Importance
**[Architectural Intent]** All department-level policy mappings and manager-based approval workflows would fail. Employees could not be grouped into business units, breaking organizational reporting and compliance audits.

- **[Recommendation]** **Create New Collection Instead**: If tracking recurring metrics or department budgets (use a financial ledger or performance collection).
- **[Recommendation]** **Business Service**: Currently run on Generic CRUD. If custom validation or lifecycle hooks are needed, a new service file must be introduced.

### Policies
- **[Unknown]** **De-register Hook**: "Architectural policies not evident — requires clarification." (No database-level delete restrictions exist, meaning departments can be deleted even if employees are actively assigned to them).

### Known Constraints
UNKNOWN

### Future Recommendations
- **[Architectural Intent]** *Limitations*: The lack of check constraints allowing deletion of active departments is an intentional simplification for Version 1. Implementing a deletion blocker service is a recommended enhancement.

## 10. `designations` Collection

### Key Field Groups (UI-Friendly Overview)
(UI-Friendly Overview)
- **Basic Details**: Designation title, designation description.

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** The `designations` collection exists to standardize and index job roles and ranks across the company. Without it, employee job titles would be free-text strings, making it impossible to perform structured reporting on ranks, grades, and role hierarchies.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It standardizes job titles across the organization, which eliminates grade confusion and ensures consistency in payroll packages, eligibility criteria, and designation-based asset assignments.

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: None.
- **[Verified]** **Child / References**: Referenced by `employees` (via `professionalInfo.designation`).

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Registry**. It serves as a static master index of professional titles.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To support rank-based access control, automated grade-based salary bands, and designation-based hardware provisioning rules.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** Since multiple employees share the same designation, embedding designations would duplicate title and description strings, leading to synchronization errors during job title updates.

### Architectural Importance
**[Architectural Intent]** Employee titles would revert to inconsistent free-text entries, breaking designation-based reports, grade-based payroll logic, and role-based permissions.

## 11. `leavetypes` Collection

### Key Field Groups (UI-Friendly Overview)
(UI-Friendly Overview)
- **Basic Details**: Leave type name, description.
- **Balance Limits**: Maximum days allowed per month, maximum days allowed per year, carry forward flag.
- **Workflow settings**: Requires approval flag, active status flag.

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** To define and configure the types of leaves available to employees (e.g., Sick Leave, Casual Leave, Loss of Pay). It defines baseline limits and approval rules. Without it, leave request engines and payroll calculation tables could not categorize or restrict leave durations.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** Ensures legal compliance and corporate policy governance for paid/unpaid leaves. It removes the operational pain of manually checking leave eligibility and automates balance tracking.

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: None.
- **[Verified]** **Child / References**: Referenced by `leavepolicies` (via `leaves.leaveType`), `leaves` (via `leaveType`), and `attendances` (via `leaveType`).

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Historical**. It defines registries governing time-tracking history.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To support dynamic leave entitlement engines, year-end leave balance rollover operations, and automated payroll loss-of-pay (LOP) deductions.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** Separating leave types allows HR admins to dynamically configure new leave categories (e.g. Maternity Leave, Bereavement Leave) without modifying codebase files or database schemas.

### Architectural Importance

## 12. `leavepolicy` Collection

### Key Field Groups (UI-Friendly Overview)
(UI-Friendly Overview)
- **Basic Info**: Policy name, description, active status flag, version.
- **Scheduling**: Policy status (`Draft`, `Scheduled`, `Active`, `Expired`), `effectiveFrom`, `effectiveTo`.
- **Entitlements**: Leaves rules array (referencing leave types, max monthly/yearly days, carry forward flags).
- **Target Audience**: Applicable roles array (ref), applicable departments array (ref), applicable designations array (ref).

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** The `leavepolicy` collection groups multiple leave types and defines custom limits, mapping them collectively to specific employee roles, departments, or designations. Without it, leave entitlements would have to be assigned to each employee individually, causing severe administrative overhead.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It automates the assignment of leave benefits based on employee categories (e.g., contract workers vs. permanent staff), eliminating errors in leave balance allocations.

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: `roles` (via `applicableRoles`), `leavetypes` (via `leaves.leaveType`), `departments` (via `applicableDepartments`), `designations` (via `applicableDesignations`).
- **[Verified]** **Child / References**: Referenced by `departments` (via `leavePolicy`), `designations` (via `leavePolicy`), and `employees` (via `professionalInfo.leavePolicyOverride`). Queried during employee registration/onboarding and dynamic policy resolution.

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Historical**. It defines rules that govern time-tracking history and accruals.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To manage dynamic role-based benefits, tenure-based leave accrual adjustments, and compliance checking.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** Leave policies are shared across multiple roles and departments. Embedding policy objects inside employee records would prevent central policy updates from propagating to employees instantly.

### Architectural Importance
**[Architectural Intent]** Role-based leave structures would break, and HR would have to manually compute and update leave balances for every employee.

## 13. `tasktypes` Collection

### Key Field Groups (UI-Friendly Overview)
(UI-Friendly Overview)
- **Basic Details**: Task type name, description, active status flag.
- **Estimation & Class**: Estimated baseline hours, category (enum: Development, Testing, Design, Documentation, Meeting).
- **UI Presentation**: Icon name, color code (hex/rgb).

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** To define standard classes of tasks. It supplies baseline estimated hours and UI presentation styling (colors, icons) for task boards. Without it, categorizations would be arbitrary strings, and compiling productivity analytics by task category would be impossible.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It standardizes task classifications, which allows managers to evaluate where engineering hours are spent (e.g., coding vs. documentation) and automates default time allocations.

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: None.
- **[Verified]** **Child / References**: Referenced by `tasks` (via `taskTypeId` or `taskType`).

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Registry**. It serves as a master configuration table for task board categories.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To feed machine learning estimation engines, drive project health dashboards, and compute granular employee productivity indices.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** Separation allows administrators to customize task categories, estimated hours, and visual tags dynamically from the admin panel without editing UI assets or rebuilding code.

### Architectural Importance
**[Architectural Intent]** Tasks would lose standard category structures, visual color indicators on Kanban boards would break, and automated developer velocity calculations would fail.

## 14. `clients` Collection

### Key Field Groups (UI-Friendly Overview)
(UI-Friendly Overview)
- **Account Identification**: Client name, owner name, business type, contact email, contact phone.
- **Primary Address**: Street, city, state, zip code, country.
- **Compliance Registry**: GSTIN (15-character uppercase string).
- **Pipeline Stage**: Lead source, lead status (enum), lead type reference (ref), reference type reference (ref).
- **Operational Status**: Status (Active, Inactive).
- **Assigned Stakeholders**: Client agents (ref), account manager (ref), project manager (ref), project types array (ref), proposed products (ref).
- **Milestone Logs**: Milestone status array (containing milestoneId (ref), status, assignedTo (ref), dueDate, completedDate, notes).

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** The `clients` collection acts as the master directory of all customer accounts, sales lead stages, compliance details, and billing assignments. It connects client-facing modules (like support tickets) with internal project execution modules (like tasks and milestones). Without it, isolating customer data or tracking SLAs would be impossible.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It eliminates the operational pain of maintaining disconnected CRM and project management tools. It provides a single record of client compliance details, active projects, SLA managers, and milestone statuses.

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: `leadTypes` (via `leadType`), `referenceTypes` (via `referenceType`).
- **[Verified]** **Child / References**: References `agents` (via `agent`), `employees` (via `accountManager`, `projectManager`, `milestones.assignedTo`), `projecttypes` (via `projectTypes`), `products` (via `proposedProducts`), and `milestones` (via `milestones.milestoneId`). Referenced by `tickets` (via `clientId`) and `tasks` (via `clientId`).

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Registry**. It holds the master identity and contract parameters of external customer accounts.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To drive automated customer billing, manage service level agreement (SLA) metrics, and power customer support portals.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** Clients possess complex contact, compliance, and milestone data structures that are shared across multiple tickets, tasks, and agents. Embedding client details in those transactional collections would cause massive data duplication.

### Architectural Importance
**[Architectural Intent]** External customer billing and compliance records would be lost. Support agents could not associate incoming tickets with customers, and project manager assignments would break.

## 15. `projecttypes` Collection

### Key Field Groups (UI-Friendly Overview)
(UI-Friendly Overview)
- **Basic Info**: Project type name, description, active status flag.
- **Constraints**: Default estimated hours, complexity rating (enum: Low, Medium, High).

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** To categorize client projects and define standard complexity ratings and estimated baselines. Without it, compiling project estimation metrics and comparing delivery schedules across project types would be impossible.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It automates the classification of project workloads and standardizes SLA baselines based on project complexity (e.g., Mobile App vs. Consultation), preventing under-estimation of deliverables.

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: None.
- **[Verified]** **Child / References**: Referenced by `clients` (via `projectTypes`) and `tasks` (via `projectTypeId`).

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Registry**. It holds static master parameters defining project classification templates.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To support template-driven project creation, automated billing rates based on complexity, and velocity tracking.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** Since multiple clients and projects share the same template configuration, separation avoids duplicating description and complexity strings.

### Architectural Importance

## 16. `accesspolicies` Collection

### Key Field Groups (UI-Friendly Overview)
(UI-Friendly Overview)
- **Role Mapping**: Target role reference (ref).
- **Target Model**: Collection/Model name string.
- **CRUD Matrix**: Permissions flags (read, create, update, delete).
- **Granular Restrictions**: Forbidden access fields list (arrays for read, create, update, delete).
- **Allowed Inclusions**: Allow access fields list (arrays for read, create, update, delete).
- **Scopes & Logic**: Registry scope tags, conditional query rules map.

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** To store fine-grained, database-driven role-based access control (RBAC) rules. Rather than hardcoding user permissions, the policy middleware evaluates these documents to validate requests and filter fields. Without it, altering user access permissions would require editing backend code and redeploying.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It prevents unauthorized data access and leaks (e.g., hiding salary figures from regular employees, restricting client agents from viewing internal developer tasks). It allows compliance admins to modify permissions in real-time.

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: `roles` (via `role`).
- **[Verified]** **Runtime**: Queried by the backend validation middlewares for every API hit and database query.

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Configuration**. It governs the operational behavior and security limits of the system.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To support dynamic field-level and row-level data isolation based on organizational hierarchies (e.g. "employees can only view colleagues in their own department").

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** Permissions change independently of user profiles or roles. Keeping them in a dedicated collection allows fast indexing and real-time security updates without lock contention on user profiles.

### Architectural Importance
**[Architectural Intent]** The system authorization engine would fail, leaving the application unsecured, or forcing a rollback to a rigid, hardcoded permission model.

## 17. `roles` Collection

### Key Field Groups (UI-Friendly Overview)
(UI-Friendly Overview)
- **Basic Details**: Role name, description, active status flag.
- **Capabilities Matrix**: Authorized capability tags array.
- **Hierarchy Rank**: Security clearance level (integer, 1 to 10).

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** To define access privilege groups (e.g., Super Admin, HR, Employee) and their capabilities. Without it, managing employee clearances and grouping system permissions would be impossible.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** Eliminates the operational risk of manual permission assignment. Assigning a role to a new employee automatically grants them all associated capabilities, simplifying employee onboarding.

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: None.
- **[Verified]** **Child / References**: Referenced by `employees` (via `professionalInfo.role`), `accesspolicies` (via `role`), `leavepolicies` (via `applicableRoles`), and `HRPolicy` (via `roles`).

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Registry**. It serves as the master database lookup for access groups.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To serve as the foundation of the platform's multi-tenant security model, supporting hierarchical approval chains and security clearances.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** Roles and capabilities are shared by many employees. Embedding them would duplicate strings and make capability updates slow and error-prone.

### Architectural Importance

## 18. `session` Collection

### Key Field Groups (UI-Friendly Overview)
(UI-Friendly Overview)
- **User Mapping**: Target user reference (ref).
- **Auth Tokens**: Access token details (token, secret, expiry), refresh token details (token, secret, jti, expiry).
- **Platform Identity**: Platform (web, mobile), device UUID, Firebase FCM token.
- **Context Details**: Connection status (Active, DeActive, PendingApproval), device metadata (name, os, userAgent, ipAddress), last used timestamp.

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** To manage active user logins, support JWT refresh token rotation, track user devices, and hold Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) tokens. Without it, the system could not invalidate a login, revoke a compromised token, or route push notifications to specific user devices.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** Prevents unauthorized account hijacking by allowing users and admins to view active login locations, identify suspicious devices, and revoke active sessions instantly.

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: `employees` (via `userId`).
- **[Verified]** **Runtime**: Queried by auth middleware to validate sessions and verify JWT refresh tokens.

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Operational**. It manages highly dynamic login state transitions.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To support secure multi-device token management, device telemetry logging, and targeted mobile push notifications.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** Sessions are highly ephemeral and updated on every page load/action. Embedding session data in employee profiles would cause database lock contention and performance degradation.

### Architectural Importance
**[Architectural Intent]** JWT token refresh operations would fail, users would be logged out on token expiry, and push notifications would fail to reach client devices.

- **Status & Priority**: Completed status flag, priority rating (low, medium, high), due date, category (personal, work, meeting, deadline).

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** To provide employees with a personal checklist manager directly inside Tracker. Without it, employees would need external to-do apps, fragmenting their daily workflows.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It helps individual workers organize their daily schedule and deadlines, which increases productivity and reduces missed deadlines.

### Relationships

- **Target Record**: Model/Collection name, document identifier.
- **Operation details**: Action type (create, update, delete).
- **Actor context**: User identifier, user role.
- **Payload Snapshots**: State before modification, state after modification, custom metadata.

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** The `auditlog` collection exists to log all data mutations across the database. Without it, tracking who changed a value, when they changed it, and what the original value was would be impossible, creating a massive security and auditing gap.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It prevents internal fraud, aids error recovery by tracking what data was changed, and supplies data audits for enterprise compliance.

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: References the user who performed the operation (via `userId`).
- **[Verified]** **Child / References**: Dynamically references modified records via `model` and `docId`.

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Historical**. It is a read-only, append-only historical log of system mutations.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To provide a complete audit trail for security compliance and support automated data rollback tools.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** Audit logs are write-heavy and read-rarely. Keeping them separate prevents query slowdowns on transactional tables and ensures logs are protected from modifications.

- **Location Context**: API route or function name.
- **User Context**: Employee reference (ref) who encountered the error.
- **Severity**: Level (Info, Warning, Error, Critical).

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** To capture and store unhandled exceptions and stack traces in the backend application. Without it, debugging production crashes would require manual access to server console logs.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It reduces downtime by capturing exactly why an error occurred and which employee encountered it, allowing development teams to isolate and fix bugs quickly.

## 27. `leaves` Collection

### Key Field Groups (UI-Friendly Overview)
(UI-Friendly Overview)
- **Identity & Context**: Employee reference (ref), employee name, department reference (ref), manager reference (ref).
- **Type & Range**: Leave type reference (ref), leave name, start date, end date, total days.
- **Workflow State**: Status (Pending, Approved, Rejected), metaStatus (active/inactive), emergency flag.
- **Approvals Ledger**: Workflow reference (ref), current step index, approvals array (step index, approver reference, approver type, status, comment, actioned timestamp).
- **Resolution**: Approved timestamp, rejected timestamp, manager comments, uploaded documents.

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** The `leaves` collection exists to manage the submission, tracking, and approval lifecycle of employee leave requests. It dynamically routes requests through role-based approval steps defined in approval workflows. Without it, managing employee time-off requests and tracking team availability dynamically would be impossible.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It automates leave requests, reducing HR administration overhead. It enforces leave policy limits at the moment of submission, prevents double-booking within departments, and logs approvals for compliance.

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: `employees` (via `employeeId`, `managerId`), `departments` (via `departmentId`), `leavetypes` (via `leaveTypeId`), `approvalworkflows` (via `workflowId`).
- **[Verified]** **Child / References**: Referenced by the payroll engine during monthly runs to compute LOP deductions.

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Workflow**. It utilizes dynamic state progression, multi-step approval arrays, and triggers calculations in the payroll layer.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To supply availability metrics to team calendars, automate payroll calculations, and enforce corporate compliance policies.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** Leave requests are transaction-oriented, highly mutable during approval, and grow indefinitely. Embedding them inside employee records would lead to document size violations and lock contention.

### Architectural Importance
**[Architectural Intent]** Time-off requests would revert to manual emails, leave policy balances could not be enforced, and payroll LOP deductions would have to be calculated manually from emails.

- **[Recommendation]** **Business Service**: Hook validations and status updates are managed in [leaves.js](file:///E:/Loigmax/Tracker/backend/src/services/leaves.js).

### Policies
- **[Verified]** **Approval Workflow Lock**: Once status is set to `Approved` or `Rejected`, further status transitions are locked.
- **[Verified]** **Historical Lock**: Modifying leaves for periods in closed/approved payroll runs is blocked.

### Known Constraints

## 28. `assetallocations` Collection

### Key Field Groups (UI-Friendly Overview)
(UI-Friendly Overview)
- **Assignee Context**: Asset reference (ref), employee reference (ref), department reference (ref).
- **Allocation Details**: Type (Allocation, Transfer, Temporary), allocation date, expected return date, actual return date.
- **Workflow State**: Status (Pending Approval, Active, Returned, Transferred, Rejected), metaStatus.
- **Return Context**: Returned condition (enum), return notes.
- **Approvals Ledger**: Workflow reference (ref), current step index, approvals array (step index, approver reference, approver type, status, comment, actioned timestamp).

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** The `assetallocations` collection manages the lifecycle of physical corporate assets assigned to employees. It coordinates the approval loops for device checkouts, tracking asset transfers and returns. Without it, tracking who currently holds a device, the condition of returned hardware, and approval histories would be impossible.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It prevents hardware loss and coordinates equipment deployments. It ensures approvals are obtained before high-value devices are handed out and logs device conditions on return.

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: `assets` (via `assetId`), `employees` (via `employeeId`), `departments` (via `departmentId`), `approvalworkflows` (via `workflowId`).
- **[Verified]** **Child / References**: Used during employee termination to ensure all allocated assets are returned before final clearance.

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Workflow**. It manages physical assets transitions through multi-stage approval status arrays.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To automate inventory management, track physical asset deprecations, and enforce hardware compliance policies.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** An asset can have a long history of assignments, returns, and transfers. Separating it from the `assets` and `employees` collections preserves the audit trail without bloating those master documents.

### Architectural Importance
**[Architectural Intent]** The organization would lose track of who holds which hardware. HR could not enforce exit clearance checks, and loss of equipment would increase.

- **[Recommendation]** **Business Service**: Allocations and status syncs are governed by [assetallocations.js](file:///E:/Loigmax/Tracker/backend/src/services/assetallocations.js).

### Policies
- **[Verified]** **Clearance Blocker**: Prevents employee termination if they hold active allocations.
- **[Verified]** **Asset Status Sync**: Transitioning status to `Active` automatically shifts the underlying asset's status to `Allocated`.

### Known Constraints
UNKNOWN

### Future Recommendations
- **[Architectural Intent]** *Limitations*: The allocation condition enum is checked only during return. Dynamic inspection checks during allocation are reserved for future releases.

## 29. `payrollruns` Collection

### Key Field Groups (UI-Friendly Overview)
(UI-Friendly Overview)
- **Period**: Month, year.
- **Workflow State**: Status (Draft, Processing, Computed, Approved, Paid).
- **Aggregation Summary**: Total employees, processed count, failed count, total gross payout, total net payout.
- **Approvals & Audits**: Initiated by (ref), approved by (ref), approved at, paid at, notes.
- **Run Elements**: Employee references array (ref), payroll references array (ref).
- **Audit Logs**: Payroll audit events array (event, performed by (ref), timestamp, note).

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** The `payrollruns` collection exists to orchestrate the monthly payroll calculation cycle for groups of employees. It acts as a state machine that tracks payroll calculations from initiation to final bank payouts. Without it, processing salaries at scale and logging financial audits of monthly payouts would be impossible.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It automates mass salary calculations, prevents double-payment errors, and logs approval audit paths to ensure financial compliance and prevent fraud.

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: `employees` (via `initiatedBy`, `approvedBy`).
- **[Verified]** **Child / References**: References `employees` (via `employeeIds` array) and `payrolls` (via `payrollIds` array).

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Workflow**. It dictates state transitions (`Draft` ➔ `Processing` ➔ `Computed` ➔ `Approved` ➔ `Paid`) that freeze transaction entries.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To drive automated salary transfers, compile statutory filings (PF, ESI), and generate financial audit reports.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** Salary processing must be run as a transactional batch. Overwriting individual payslips without a parent run would make audit trails and batch rollbacks impossible.

### Architectural Importance
**[Architectural Intent]** Payroll calculations would have to be run for employees individually, increasing processing times and risking payout discrepancies.

- **Assignee Context**: Employee reference (ref), department reference (ref), manager reference (ref).
- **Details**: Start date, end date, reason.
- **Workflow State**: Status (Pending, Approved, Rejected, Cancelled), approver comment.

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** The `wfhrequests` collection tracks and manages Work From Home requests. Without it, attendance calculations would mark remote employees absent on days they work remotely.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It automates remote work requests, giving management visibility into who is working remotely and ensuring attendance evaluations adjust check-in rules (e.g. bypass geofencing).

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: `employees` (via `employeeId`, `managerId`), `departments` (via `departmentId`).
- **[Verified]** **Child / References**: Attendance calculations check this collection to validate check-ins.

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Workflow**. It manages remote work approvals.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To support flexible hybrid schedules and feed remote work location logs to attendance metrics.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** WFH requests are dynamic transactions with their own approval paths. Storing them inside employee profiles would cause document bloat.

- **Employee Context**: Employee reference (ref), department reference (ref), manager reference (ref).
- **Details**: Worked date, hours worked, reason, expiry date.
- **Workflow State**: Status (Pending, Approved, Rejected, Cancelled), approver comment.

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** To manage compensatory off requests submitted by employees who worked on holidays or weekly off days. Without it, tracking overtime credits and allocating comp-off days would be manual.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It automates overtime allocations, ensuring employees get leave credits for overtime hours while protecting the organization from incorrect leave accumulations.

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: `employees` (via `employeeId`, `managerId`), `departments` (via `departmentId`).
- **[Verified]** **Child / References**: Successful approvals create credits in `leavetransactions` with a 90-day expiry limit.

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Workflow**. It drives overtime allocations.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To support overtime tracking and balance accrual engines.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** Comp-off requests require validation of check-in histories for the worked date. Storing this inside leaves would violate boundary separations.

- **Punches**: Original check-in/out timestamps, requested check-in/out timestamps.
- **Workflow State**: Status (Pending, Approved, Rejected), metaStatus.
- **Approvals Ledger**: Workflow reference (ref), current step index, approvals array (step index, approver reference, approver type, status, comment, actioned timestamp).
- **Resolution Details**: Approved by (ref), approved at, rejected by (ref), rejected at, approver comment.

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** The `regularizations` collection manages requests to correct missing or incorrect check-in/out logs. Without it, check-in errors or missing check-out entries would permanently lead to incorrect LOP deductions.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It automates attendance adjustments, ensuring employees are not penalized for forgotten punches while keeping an audit log of corrections.

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: `employees` (via `employeeId`, `managerId`, `approvedBy`, `rejectedBy`), `departments` (via `departmentId`), `attendances` (via `attendanceId`), `approvalworkflows` (via `workflowId`).
- **[Verified]** **Child / References**: None.

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Workflow**. It adjusts historical attendance records.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To ensure accurate inputs are sent to the payroll engine.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** Regularizations represent corrections to historical data. Keeping corrections in a dedicated collection preserves the original logs for audit compliance.

### Architectural Importance

- **Employee Context**: Employee reference (ref), version count, created by reference (ref).
- **Period Validity**: Effective from date, effective to date.
- **Monetary Snapshot**: CTC total, overtime rate, ESI applicable flag.
- **Earnings Breakdown**: Earnings array (name, type, amount, taxable flag, proratable flag).
- **Deductions Breakdown**: Deductions array (name, type, amount, ceiling limit).
- **Statutory Details**: PF employee percentage, PF ceiling limit.

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** The `salarystructures` collection tracks salary structures, CTC values, and tax rules for each employee. Without it, the payroll engine could not calculate dynamic earnings, deductions, or statutory contributions (PF/ESI).

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It standardizes compensation components, tracks salary progression historically, and automates tax deductions.

### Relationships
- **[Verified]** **Parent**: `employees` (via `employeeId`, `createdBy`).
- **[Verified]** **Child / References**: Queried by the payroll engine during payroll runs to process payouts.

### Architectural Category
**[Verified]** **Financial**. It defines core payroll parameters.

### Ultimate Goal
**[Architectural Intent]** To drive salary calculations, compliance reporting, and tax structures.

### Reason for Separate Collection
**[Architectural Intent]** Salary structures change over time (e.g. annual appraisals). Storing structures in a dedicated collection with validity dates preserves historical salary records.

- **Steps Matrix**: Steps array (step order, approver type (enum), specific role reference (ref), specific user reference (ref), timeout days).

### Business Purpose
**[Verified]** The `approvalworkflows` collection defines step-by-step routing paths for transaction approvals. Without it, transaction routing (e.g. leaves, regularizations) would be hardcoded in backend endpoints.

### Business Problem
**[Architectural Intent]** It allows organizations to modify approval paths (e.g., adding an HR step or manager validation step) without modifying codebase files.
